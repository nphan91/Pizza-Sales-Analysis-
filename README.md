2. Determine the average order value (AOV) by dividing total revenue by the total number of orders.  
3. Assess the total number of pizzas sold.  
4. Analyze the total number of unique orders placed.  
5. Compute the average number of pizzas sold per order by dividing the total pizzas sold by the total number of orders.
